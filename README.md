# SharpTTS
A tool I'm writing for a friend of mine to easily allow the use of text to speech synthesized voices in applications like Skype.

##Requirements:
* .Net 4.6
* A "Recording Device" that can have audio pushed through it (I recommend the VB-Cable Driver from http://vb-audio.pagesperso-orange.fr/Cable/, it's free and functions well)
